# Ricardo Morim
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ricardo Morim, a 19-year-old aspiring software engineer from Portugal. Iâ€™m currently in my second year of studying Software Engineering at ISEP.

# About Me
ðŸŒŸ Passionate about programming, with a strong focus on full-stack development, AI, and object-oriented programming (OOP) with Java.

ðŸŽ“ Completed several courses, including:

- CS50X
- Frontend Simplified
- Front-End Web Development with React
- React + Firebase Course
- CS50 AI
- Hugging Face Deep Reinforcement Learning Course (currently enrolled)

ðŸ’¡ I am continuously working on developing both my front-end and back-end skills, with a focus on creating dynamic and scalable applications.

# Projects
Here are some of the projects Iâ€™ve worked on:

1. **Full-Stack Web Applications**  
   - Built multiple full-stack applications using technologies such as React, Node.js, Express, Firebase, and MongoDB, focusing on building scalable, responsive, and secure systems.

2. **AI and Machine Learning Projects**  
   - Engaged in AI projects, specifically in Reinforcement Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP), using frameworks like Pytorch, TensorFlow, and Hugging Face.

3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Java**  
   - Worked on several projects implementing OOP principles in Java, building scalable and maintainable applications.

4. **Match Dinner Website**  
   - Developed and maintain the [Match Dinner website](https://matchdinnermondays.pt), a platform for users to connect over shared meals, featuring a robust backend and a smooth, user-friendly frontend.

5. **Stock Information Website**  
   - Built a [Stock Information](https://stockinformation.vercel.app/stocks) website that fetches real-time stock data using external APIs. It includes a fallback API to ensure that users can always retrieve stock information, even if the primary API fails.
