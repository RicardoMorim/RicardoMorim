# Ricardo Morim
ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ricardo Morim, a software engineering student at ISEP in Portugal, focused on full-stack development, AI, and object-oriented programming. Visit my [portfolio website](https://ricardoportfolio.vercel.app) to learn more about my work and experience.

# Professional Summary
I specialize in building scalable web applications and exploring artificial intelligence applications. My experience spans full-stack development, reinforcement learning, and object-oriented programming with Java.

# ðŸŽ“ Completed several courses, including:

- Harvard's CS50X
- Front-End Web Development with React
- React + Firebase Course
- Harvard's CS50 AI
- Hugging Face Deep Reinforcement Learning Course (currently enrolled)

ðŸ’¡ I am continuously working on developing both my front-end and back-end skills, with a focus on creating dynamic and scalable applications.

# Projects
Here are some of the projects Iâ€™ve worked on:

1. **Full-Stack Web Applications**  
   - Built multiple full-stack applications using technologies such as React, Node.js, Express, Firebase, and MongoDB, focusing on building scalable, responsive, and secure systems.

2. **AI and Machine Learning Projects**  
   - Engaged in AI projects, specifically in Reinforcement Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP), using frameworks like Pytorch, TensorFlow, and Hugging Face.

3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Java**  
   - Worked on several projects implementing OOP principles in Java, building scalable and maintainable applications.

4. **Match Dinner Website**  
   - Developed and maintain the [Match Dinner website](https://matchdinnermondays.pt), a platform for users to connect over shared meals, featuring a robust backend and a smooth, user-friendly frontend.

5. **Stock Information Website**  
   - Built a [Stock Information](https://stockinformation.vercel.app/stocks) website that fetches real-time stock data using external APIs. It includes a fallback API to ensure that users can always retrieve stock information, even if the primary API fails.
  
6. **Portfolio Website**
   - Built a [portfolio](ricardoportfolio.vercel.app) website with a modern, responsive showcase of my work built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
